# batch.nettest-
a basic, modifiable network testing script for personal or tech support use.

Features:
 Non-Invasive: diagnostic only, can do no harm. Even checks to make sure the file it writes the log to does not already exist.

 Automatically open logfile: Don't worry about users having to search for the logfile, the script finishes by opening a notepad window with the log.

 All the basics: ipconfig /all, pings to localhost, IP, and domain name, even traceroute.

 Light: less than 5KB. Easy on users with slow download speeds.

 Modular: Don't need a specific test? You can easily disable it.
